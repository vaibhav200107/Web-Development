        <p>A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a
            beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources,
            such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and structures, depending
            on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of
            material. </p>

        <p>Though some beaches form on freshwater locations, most beaches are in coastal areas where wave or current
            action deposits and reworks sediments. Erosion and changing of beach geologies happens through natural
            processes, like wave action and extreme weather events. Where wind conditions are correct, beaches can be
            backed by coastal dunes which offer protection and regeneration for the beach. However, these natural forces
            have become more extreme due to climate change, permanently altering beaches at very rapid rates. Some
            estimates describe as much as 50 percent of the earth's sandy beaches disappearing by 2100 due to
            climate-change driven sea level rise.</p>

            These beaches are popular for recreation, playing important economic and cultural rolesâ€”often driving local
            tourism industries. To support these uses, some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard
            posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts,
            camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby or housing, both for permanent and seasonal residents.

            Human forces have significantly changed beaches globally: direct impacts include bad construction practices
            on dunes and coastlines, while indirect human impacts include water pollution, plastic pollution and coastal
            erosion from sea level rise and climate change

            Some coastal management practices are designed to preserve or restore natural beach processes, while some
            beaches are actively restored through practices like beach nourishment.
